# Tom At Solihull
👋 Welcome! This ~~is~~ was a place for me, [Tom](https://github.com/t5r7), to organise work undertaken while studying a [BTEC Nationals Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-nationals/it-2010.html), Networking and System Support (what a mouthful!) at [Solihull College](https://solihull.ac.uk).  
All work and content here was created and completed between September 2021 and Early May 2023. As of August 2023, I [completed](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7094610708809531392-QxMc) this course with the top grade of Distinction\*Distinction\*Distinction\*. If you'd like a copy of any completed assignment, or any of my notes, please get in touch and I'll be happy to help!
