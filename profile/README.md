# Tom At Solihull
👋 Welcome! This is a place for [me (@itsmeimtom](https://github.com/itsmeimtom)) to organise work undertaken while studying a [Pearson EdExcel BTEC Nationals Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-nationals/it-2010.html) (what a mouthful!) at [Solihull College](https://solihull.ac.uk).

## Start Here
- [**📚 Assignments**](https://github.com/tomatsolihull/assignments)  
   An organised collection of all my finished assignment work. Also includes links to projects relating to specific units and assignments.
- [**📝 Notes**](https://github.com/tomatsolihull/notes)  
   My [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook covering many topics covered in the qualification.

If some links above don't work, check back after July 2023; I plan to make as much as possible public when I graduate. In the meantime, you can [explore](https://github.com/tomatsolihull) the rest of the organisation.

All work and content here was created and completed between September 2021 and July 2023. 

You may also be interested in my classmate George's work, available [here](https://github.com/georgeatsolihull).
