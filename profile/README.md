# Tom At Solihull
üëã Welcome! This is a place for me, [@itsmeimtom](https://github.com/itsmeimtom), to organise work undertaken while studying a [Pearson EdExcel BTEC Nationals Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-nationals/it-2010.html) (what a mouthful!) at [Solihull College](https://solihull.ac.uk). All work and content here was created and completed between September 2021 and July 2023. 


## Start Here
- [**üìö Assignments**](https://github.com/tomatsolihull/assignments)  
   An organised collection of all my finished assignment work. Also includes links to projects relating to specific units and assignments.
- [**üìù Notes**](https://github.com/tomatsolihull/notes)  
   My [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notebook covering many topics covered in the qualification.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  
   If some links above don't work, check back after July 2023; I plan to make as much as possible public when I graduate.  
   In the meantime, you can [explore](https://github.com/tomatsolihull) the rest of the organisation.

You may also be interested in my classmate [George](https://github.com/gxorge)'s work, available [here](https://github.com/georgeatsolihull). Mine is obviously better though.

## Thanks
A special thanks goes out to my lovely classmates‚Äîtoo many to list here‚Äîas well as Solihull's excellent tutors: Neil, Chris, James, Noreen, and Shaista.
